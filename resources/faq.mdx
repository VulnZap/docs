## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is VulnZap?">
    VulnZap is powered by **Faraday**, an AI-powered multi-agent security analysis engine that provides intelligent vulnerability scanning for code. Unlike traditional scanners, Faraday deploys specialized AI agents that collaborate like a human security team.
    
    **Key Features:**
    - Multi-agent architecture (Vulnerability Scanner, Context Validator, Scoring, Remediation agents)
    - &lt;5% false positive rate (vs 20-40% for traditional SAST)
    - 5-7 minute full repository scans
    - Automated remediation with working patches
    - MCP protocol integration for AI coding agents
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is VulnZap different from Snyk, Veracode, or other SAST tools?">
    **Key Differentiators:**
    
    1. **Agent-Aware**: VulnZap understands AI coding assistants and can guide them to generate secure code
    2. **MCP Protocol**: Native integration with Cursor, Windsurf, Cline
    3. **Real-Time Feedback**: &lt;100ms inline scanning as you type
    4. **Deterministic Patches**: Context-aware fixes that preserve code style
    5. **Low False Positives**: Exploitability-first ranking (&lt;5% FP rate vs industry average of 20-30%)
    6. **Developer-First**: Built for developer velocity, not just security teams
    
    **Traditional SAST:** Post-commit scanning, high false positives, generic fixes
    
    **VulnZap:** Pre-commit prevention, low noise, intelligent fixes

## Features & Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is agent-aware scanning?">
    **Agent-aware scanning** means VulnZap's Faraday engine works with AI coding agents through MCP tools to provide non-blocking, asynchronous security scanning.
    
    **How it works:**
    1. Agent calls `vulnzap.scan_diff` at checkpoints (fire-and-forget)
    2. Agent continues coding while Faraday analyzes in background
    3. Agent polls `vulnzap.status` to check for issues
    4. If vulnerabilities found, agent fixes and rescans
    5. Before push, agent calls `vulnzap.full_scan` for comprehensive check
    
    **Supported via MCP:**
    - Cursor
    - Windsurf
    - Cline
    - VS Code (with MCP extension)
    
    See [IDE Integration](/features/ide-integration) for MCP tools documentation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can VulnZap automatically fix vulnerabilities?">
    **Yes.** VulnZap generates context-aware patches for most vulnerabilities.
    
    **Auto-Fix Capabilities:**
    - **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries
    - **XSS**: HTML escaping, sanitization
    - **Path Traversal**: Path normalization
    - **Command Injection**: Safe execution methods
    - **Weak Crypto**: Strong algorithms
    - **And 40+ more patterns**
    
    **Application Methods:**
    - **Interactive**: Review each fix before applying
    - **Automatic**: Apply all fixes at once (use with caution)
    - **Export**: Generate patches for manual review
    
    **Success Rate:** ~85% of findings have auto-applicable fixes
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How accurate is VulnZap? What about false positives?">
    **Faraday Accuracy:**
    - **False Positive Rate**: &lt;5%
    - **Industry Average**: 20-40% false positive rate
    - **Context Validator**: Eliminates 90%+ of false positives
    
    **How Faraday achieves low false positives:**
    
    1. **Context Validator Agent** (The Game-Changer):
       - Uses file system tools (grep, readFile, find) to cross-reference findings
       - Verifies vulnerabilities against actual code evidence
       - Understands sanitization, validation, and protection layers
       - Checks for ORM usage, middleware, and security controls
    
    2. **Multi-Agent Verification**:
       - Vulnerability Scanner detects potential issues
       - Context Validator verifies with real code evidence
       - Scoring Agent assesses actual exploitability
       - Only real vulnerabilities make it to final report
    
    3. **Semantic Understanding**:
       - Understands code intent, not just syntax
       - Recognizes framework security patterns
    
    **Real Impact:**
    - Traditional: 1,247 findings (71% false positives)
    - Faraday: 67 findings (4% false positives)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does VulnZap work with monorepos?">
    **Yes.** VulnZap fully supports monorepos with:
    
    - **Multi-language detection**: Different languages in same repo
    - **Workspace support**: Multiple packages/projects
    - **Selective scanning**: Scan specific workspaces
    - **Cross-project analysis**: Understand dependencies
    
    **Performance:**
    - Incremental scanning only checks changed workspaces
    - Parallel scanning across workspaces
    - Caching prevents re-scanning unchanged code
    
    **Example Monorepo Support:**
    - Nx
    - Lerna
    - Turborepo
    - Yarn Workspaces
    - npm Workspaces
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I customize detection rules?">
    **Yes, on Scale and Enterprise plans.**
    
    **Custom Rules Include:**
    - **Custom security patterns**: Your organization's security standards
    - **Framework-specific rules**: Internal framework security requirements
    - **Suppression rules**: Ignore specific patterns with justification
    - **Severity adjustments**: Customize risk scoring
    
    **Example Custom Rule:**
    ```yaml
    - id: require-auth-middleware
      severity: high
      pattern: |
        app.$METHOD($PATH, ($REQ, $RES) => { ... })
      where:
        - not: app.$METHOD($PATH, authenticate, ...)
      message: "API routes must use authentication middleware"
    ```

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the MCP protocol?">
    **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard that enables AI assistants to use external tools. VulnZap provides 4 MCP tools for security scanning:
    
    **VulnZap MCP Tools:**
    1. **vulnzap.scan_diff**: Fast incremental scan on git diff (fire-and-forget)
    2. **vulnzap.status**: Poll for scan results and vulnerability status
    3. **vulnzap.full_scan**: Deep baseline scan of entire repository
    4. **vulnzap.report**: Generate human-readable markdown reports
    
    **How agents use it:**
    - Agent calls `scan_diff` at natural checkpoints
    - Continues coding while scan runs in background
    - Polls `status` to check progress (5-30 second backoff)
    - Fixes issues and rescans before committing
    - Calls `full_scan` before serious push/deploy
    - Generates `report` for PR descriptions
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Non-blocking: Agents don't wait for scan results
    - Asynchronous: Scans run in background
    - Efficient: Only scans changed code incrementally
    
    See [IDE Integration](/features/ide-integration) for complete MCP documentation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How fast are scans?">
    **Faraday Performance:**
    
    - **Full repository scan**: 5-7 minutes average
    - **Incremental diff scan**: 5-10 seconds
    - **MCP scan_diff**: Returns immediately, processes in background
    - **MCP status poll**: Instant (just checks completion status)
    
    **Comparison:**
    - Faraday: 5-7 minutes for full repo
    - Traditional SAST: 30-120 minutes for same repo
    
    **Why Faraday is faster:**
    - Parallel agent processing
    - Intelligent caching and deduplication
    - Focused analysis on changed code
    - Redis-backed memory coordination
    
    **For agents:**
    - Non-blocking: Continue coding while scan runs
    - Background processing: No waiting
    - Smart polling: Exponential backoff (5-30s)
  </Accordion>
