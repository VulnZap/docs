## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is VulnZap?">
    VulnZap is a security layer for agentic coding that provides real-time vulnerability scanning for AI-generated and human-written code. It detects security issues, suggests fixes, and integrates with popular IDEs and CI/CD pipelines.
    
    **Key Features:**
    - Real-time scanning as you code
    - AI-aware (understands agent-generated code)
    - OWASP Top 10 aligned detection
    - Automatic patch generation
    - MCP protocol integration for IDE/AI assistants
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is VulnZap different from Snyk, Veracode, or other SAST tools?">
    **Key Differentiators:**
    
    1. **Agent-Aware**: VulnZap understands AI coding assistants and can guide them to generate secure code
    2. **MCP Protocol**: Native integration with Cursor, Windsurf, Cline
    3. **Real-Time Feedback**: <100ms inline scanning as you type
    4. **Deterministic Patches**: Context-aware fixes that preserve code style
    5. **Low False Positives**: Exploitability-first ranking (<5% FP rate vs industry average of 20-30%)
    6. **Developer-First**: Built for developer velocity, not just security teams
    
    **Traditional SAST:** Post-commit scanning, high false positives, generic fixes
    
    **VulnZap:** Pre-commit prevention, low noise, intelligent fixes

## Features & Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is agent-aware scanning?">
    **Agent-aware scanning** means VulnZap understands when code is generated by AI assistants (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) and can:
    
    1. **Intercept** AI-generated code before it's applied
    2. **Analyze** for security vulnerabilities
    3. **Provide feedback** to the AI with secure alternatives
    4. **Guide** the AI to regenerate secure code
    
    **Example:**
    AI generates SQL injection → VulnZap detects → Suggests parameterized queries → AI regenerates secure code → Applied to editor
    
    **Requires:** MCP protocol integration (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can VulnZap automatically fix vulnerabilities?">
    **Yes.** VulnZap generates context-aware patches for most vulnerabilities.
    
    **Auto-Fix Capabilities:**
    - **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries
    - **XSS**: HTML escaping, sanitization
    - **Path Traversal**: Path normalization
    - **Command Injection**: Safe execution methods
    - **Weak Crypto**: Strong algorithms
    - **And 40+ more patterns**
    
    **Application Methods:**
    - **Interactive**: Review each fix before applying
    - **Automatic**: Apply all fixes at once (use with caution)
    - **Export**: Generate patches for manual review
    
    **Success Rate:** ~85% of findings have auto-applicable fixes
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How accurate is VulnZap? What about false positives?">
    **Accuracy Metrics:**
    - **True Positive Rate**: >95%
    - **False Positive Rate**: <5%
    - **Detection Coverage**: OWASP Top 10 + 200+ vulnerability types
    
    **How we achieve low false positives:**
    1. **Data Flow Analysis**: Track actual data flow, not just patterns
    2. **Framework Awareness**: Understand security controls in frameworks
    3. **Exploitability Ranking**: Focus on reachable, exploitable issues
    4. **Continuous Learning**: ML models improve from user feedback
    
    **Industry Comparison:**
    - Traditional SAST: 20-30% false positive rate
    - VulnZap: <5% false positive rate
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does VulnZap work with monorepos?">

    - **Multi-language detection**: Different languages in same repo
    - **Workspace support**: Multiple packages/projects
    - **Selective scanning**: Scan specific workspaces
    - **Cross-project analysis**: Understand dependencies
    
    **Performance:**
    - Incremental scanning only checks changed workspaces
    - Parallel scanning across workspaces
    - Caching prevents re-scanning unchanged code
    
    **Example Monorepo Support:**
    - Nx
    - Lerna
    - Turborepo
    - Yarn Workspaces
    - npm Workspaces
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I customize detection rules?">

    **Custom Rules Include:**
    - **Custom security patterns**: Your organization's security standards
    - **Framework-specific rules**: Internal framework security requirements
    - **Suppression rules**: Ignore specific patterns with justification
    - **Severity adjustments**: Customize risk scoring
    
    **Example Custom Rule:**
    ```yaml
    - id: require-auth-middleware
      severity: high
      pattern: |
        app.$METHOD($PATH, ($REQ, $RES) => { ... })
      where:
        - not: app.$METHOD($PATH, authenticate, ...)

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the MCP protocol?">
    **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard that enables AI assistants to communicate with external tools and receive context-aware feedback.
    
    **How VulnZap uses MCP:**
    1. AI assistant (Cursor, etc.) generates code
    2. MCP sends code to VulnZap before applying
    3. VulnZap analyzes for vulnerabilities
    4. MCP sends security feedback back to AI
    5. AI regenerates secure code
    6. Secure code applied to editor
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Real-time security without slowing development
    - AI learns from security feedback
    - Prevents insecure code before it's written
    
    See [MCP Protocol](/integration/mcp-protocol) for technical details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How fast are scans?">
