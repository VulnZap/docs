## What is VulnZap?

Real-time scanning in the editor and full-repo checks with merge-ready, minimal fixes. Quiet, precise, production-grade.

VulnZap is built for how you ship—agent-aware scanning that understands prompts, tool output, and generated diffs. From inline editor detection to CI integration, all with OWASP-aligned guidance and ready-to-merge patches.
